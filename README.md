# FutureMakers2022

Reflection of Day 1:
I learned a lot about the basic data types of Python and how to use them. I had some prior knowledge of Python, so these exercises were a good refresher, as well as a good educational tool for what I didn't know yet. It also encouraged me to look up some of the concepts I didn't know yet, and further learn about the details of those data types further than what we covered today.
