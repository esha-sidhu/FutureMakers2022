# FutureMakers2022

Reflection of Day 1:
I learned a lot about the basic data types of Python and how to use them. I had some prior knowledge of Python, so these exercises were a good refresher, as well as a good educational tool for what I didn't know yet. It also encouraged me to look up some of the concepts I didn't know yet, and further learn about the details of those data types further than what we covered today.

Reflection of Day 2:
I learned a lot about Machine Learning and Scikit-learn. The information taught in the class was really interesting, and I was encouraged to look up some more about the topic, to further learn more about Scikit-learn.

Reflection of Day 3:
The main area of focus was on deep learning, which was interesting to learn about. I previously thought machine learning and deep learning were mostly interchangeable, but I learned some of the key differences that differentiate the two.

Reflection of Day 4:
Today's class focused on TensorFlow, in which we covered some basics about how to use it. I enjoyed this lesson, since I know how useful knowledge about TensorFlow will be for my future, and I look forward to learning more about TensorFlow in the future.

Reflection of Day 5:
The main area of focus for today was artificial neural networks. This class was my favorite so far, since we were able to learn about the structure of neural networks, and how they work. I look forward to learn more about artificial neural networks as we progress in the program.
